              I{"'"}m Rad, a professional web developer with years of experience
              creating user-friendly and high-performing websites. Over time, I
              {"'"}ve honed my skills to focus on building websites that are not
              only visually appealing but also intuitive, accessible, and
              effective in achieving business goals.
              <br />
              <br />
              My work centers on four key pillars: Design, User Experience
              (UX/UI), Performance, and Accessibility. While design is
              important, it alone does not determine a website{"'"}s success.
              That{"'"}s why I prioritize UX/UI, crafting websites that are easy
              to navigate, engaging, and built to convert visitors into
              customers.
              <br />
              <br />
              Accessibility is equally critical. I ensure that every website I
              develop is usable by people with disabilities, following best
              practices to provide inclusive access to information and services.
              This approach fosters a more equitable web experience for all
              users.
              <br />
              <br />
              Performance is another top priority. I optimize websites to load
              quickly, run smoothly, and provide seamless
              interactionsâ€”benefiting both users and SEO. By combining
              thoughtful design, intuitive UX, accessibility, and high
              performance, I deliver websites that not only meet expectations
              but also drive meaningful results.
