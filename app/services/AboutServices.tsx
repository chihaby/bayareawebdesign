                <br />
                The East Bay Paratransit community depends on having a website
                that is accessible for all users, including those who are
                visually impaired, have hearing loss, or limited motor skills.
                The website was built with a simple, user-friendly design that
                makes navigation easy and works well with screen readers and
                keyboard controls. Accessibility was a priority from the start,
                and the site follows the latest WCAG 2.2 AA standards to ensure
                compliance. Features were built in to support an inclusive
                experience so every customer can find the information they need
                without barriers. The focus was to create a reliable,
                accessible, and modern website that meets the needs of East Bay
                Paratransit riders.

                Cafe Lisbon was designed with a modern and elegant style to

                different coffee blends and fresh pastries the shop offers,
                giving visitors a clear view of the menu. An About page shares
                the history of the business and the passion that drives it,
                helping customers connect with the story behind the brand. There
                is also a store page that includes practical details like the
                hours of operation and location, making it easy for people to
                plan their visit.

              <Card.Text>
                This project is a full stack application built to give the owner
                control over the website through a simple back end where new
                menu items and prices can be uploaded and updated easily. On the
                customer side, the site allows visitors to browse the menu, view
                detailed ingredients for each pizza, and even filter options by
                ingredients to find exactly what they want. Once they make their
                choice, customers can place an order directly online. The goal
                was to create a smooth experience for both the business and its
                customers, combining an easy management system for the owner
                with a user-friendly interface that makes ordering pizza online
                straightforward and convenient.

                button for joining a mailing list, along with options for
                selling merchandise. A contact form is also included for direct
                communication, and external e-commerce apps can be linked for
                more advanced selling needs. The goal was to create a simple but

                promote their work, grow their audience, and manage their
                creative brand.
